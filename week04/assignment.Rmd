# 1. Find and download the peaks from ENCODE
## a) Transcription factor p300
### We download and unzip the file that we found on ENCODE


```{R}
download.file("https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF460EOA/@@download/ENCFF460EOA.bed.gz", "p300.bed.gz")
gunzip("p300.bed.gz", remove=TRUE) 
```


## b) Histone modifications H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3
### We download and unzip the files that we found on ENCODE. We make sure that we download the file that show the original peaks, not the replicated ones


```{R}
download.file("https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF422YVG/@@download/ENCFF422YVG.bed.gz", "H3K4me3.bed.gz")
gunzip("H3K4me3.bed.gz", remove=TRUE)
```


```{R}
download.file("https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF718KBQ/@@download/ENCFF718KBQ.bed.gz", "H3K4me1.bed.gz")
gunzip("H3K4me1.bed.gz", remove=TRUE)
```


```{R}
download.file("https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF276VUE/@@download/ENCFF276VUE.bed.gz", "H3K27ac.bed.gz")
gunzip("H3K27ac.bed.gz", remove=TRUE)
```


```{R}
download.file("https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF055QNY/@@download/ENCFF055QNY.bed.gz", "H3K27me3.bed.gz")
gunzip("H3K27me3.bed.gz", remove=TRUE)
```


# 2. Question: Of the p300 peaks, what proportion overlap each of the marks?
### First we load all the peaks of the transcription factor p300 and the histone modifications

```{R}
p300_peaks <- import("p300.bed", format="narrowPeak")
H3K4me3_peaks <- import("H3K4me3.bed", format="narrowPeak")
H3K4me1_peaks <- import("H3K4me1.bed", format="narrowPeak")
H3K27ac_peaks <- import("H3K27ac.bed", format="narrowPeak")
H3K27me3_peaks <- import("H3K27me3.bed", format="narrowPeak")
```

### Now we find the total amount of peaks of p300, which is 28341 peaks

```{R}
total_p300_peaks <- length(p300_peaks)
total_p300_peaks
```
### Then we count the overlapping region of p300 with each histone modification
```{R}
overlaps_h3k4me3 <- findOverlaps(p300_peaks, H3K4me3_peaks, type="within")
num_overlaps_h3k4me3 <- length(overlaps_h3k4me3)
num_overlaps_h3k4me3
```
```{R}
overlaps_h3k4me1 <- findOverlaps(p300_peaks, H3K4me1_peaks, type="within")
num_overlaps_h3k4me1 <- length(overlaps_h3k4me1)
num_overlaps_h3k4me1
```
```{R}
overlaps_h3k27ac <- findOverlaps(p300_peaks, H3K27ac_peaks, type="within")
num_overlaps_h3k27ac <- length(overlaps_h3k27ac)
num_overlaps_h3k27ac
```
```{R}
overlaps_h3k27me3 <- findOverlaps(p300_peaks, H3K27me3_peaks, type="within")
num_overlaps_h3k27me3 <- length(overlaps_h3k27me3)
num_overlaps_h3k27me3
```
### Now we calculate the percentage of overlapping peaks

```{R}
percent_h3k4me3 <- (num_overlaps_h3k4me3 / total_p300_peaks) * 100
percent_h3k4me1 <- (num_overlaps_h3k4me1 / total_p300_peaks) * 100
percent_h3k27ac <- (num_overlaps_h3k27ac / total_p300_peaks) * 100
percent_h3k27me3 <- (num_overlaps_h3k27me3 / total_p300_peaks) * 100
```


### We show the results of our calculation

```{R}
cat("The overlapping part of p300 and H3K4me3 is:", percent_h3k4me3, "%\n") 
cat("The overlapping part of p300 and H3K4me1 is:", percent_h3k4me1, "%\n") 
cat("The overlapping part of p300 and H3K27ac is:", percent_h3k27ac, "%\n") 
cat("The overlapping part of p300 and H3K27me3 is:", percent_h3k27me3, "%\n") 
```
